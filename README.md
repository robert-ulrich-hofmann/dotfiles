# Dotfiles and Scripts

## What is this?
This repo is based on this approach: [https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20250108213337/https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html)

## "System requirements"
I'm getting questions on why X from this repo does not work on system Y. I have no idea and do not intend to support anyone. But I can tell you that I use 

- [OpenSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) (rolling release)
- with an up to date [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/)
- in a [Wayland session](https://wearewaylandnow.com/)
- on a [Framework 13 with Intel Core Ultra 7 155H and integrated Intel Arc Graphics](https://frame.work/de/en/laptop13?tab=specs&slug=laptop13-diy-intel-ultra-1).

So what I do here might not work on Debian stable, XFCE, x11, an AMD cpu, with NVIDIA...
